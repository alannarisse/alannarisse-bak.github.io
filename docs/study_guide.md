Live coding challenges
In a text editor, create a static web page that says "Hello Interview!" in red, sans-serif font and includes a title element. Open the page in the browser. (Lesson 1.1)
This project was started by 1 of your designers, and they are having some trouble getting the layout correct.
First, they used all div tags, so there's no way of knowing what the content is. Re-structure the HTML with semantic tags.
Second, this page is not accessible. Re-structure the HTML to make it work correctly for screen readers.
Next, there's an awful looking white bar at the top. The goal is to get the header to have a full-width image, with a centered title.
Finally, you will see 3 green textBoxes. They should line up in a single row. (Lesson 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)


Open the JS console and declare a variable whose value can be reassigned. (Lesson 2.1)
Define a function called print that takes 1 argument — toPrint — and logs toPrint to the console. Now, invoke that function. (Lesson 2.2)

Write a function that accepts 1 integer as an argument. The function should return true if the number is divisible by either 3 or 5, and return false otherwise. (Lesson 2.3)

Write a function that accepts an array of test scores as an argument. The function should return the number of test scores that are an 80 or higher. (Lesson 2.4)

Write a function called makeOrder. It should take a table number, an array of order items, and an order status as arguments. It should return an object with the keys tableNumber, order, and status, and their associated values. (Lesson 2.6)
