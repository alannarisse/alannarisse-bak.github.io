Glossary

Compiler: A tool that takes JavaScript code and transforms it to new JavaScript code, such as Babel.
CDN: content delivery network to serve files across the globe in an optimized manner, such as the react.development.js file.
JSX: A syntactical sugar for JavaScript similar to HTML to help write UI code.
Element: A building block in React, the output from writing a tag in JSX.
Component: A reusable piece of code to create elements.
Props: The inputs or arguments to a React component. Similar to HTML element attributes.
props.children: A special prop containing embedded elements.

Summary
When writing React applications we want to make our code reusable and customizable; custom components are great for these goals. We can use custom components that use combinations of both custom and standard props to make highly reusable code.

To avoid potential errors with how props are used inside a component, we can define default props. To add default props to a class component we use a static property. The only requirement of class components is that they contain a render method.

How we arrange various components together is called "component composition". There are many relationships "trees" between components when composed together. Some of the terms we use to describe these relationships are "parent", "child", "sibling", "ancestor", and "descendant".

When working with a list of components we can render an array containing JSX elements. Each element inside an array should have a unique key prop so that React can optimize and manage how the elements are rendered if the array is changed.

Module 10

**Objective:** By the end of this checkpoint, you can conditionally render nodes based on state and write event handlers.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll build an Accordion component.

An accordion is a website widget that has a list of content sections that start collapsed. By clicking on buttons, we can open one content section at a time. When you open one content section it closes the other.

Summary
When building React components, it is often desired to only render certain elements under certain conditions; we can achieve this with conditional rendering! Using state and conditional logic, we can show or hide certain elements in a render. To demonstrate this process, we built a "Tabs" component that renders one content "tab" at any moment, based on which tab button was last clicked.

In order to test components that update state and conditions based on events, such as button clicks, we can use the test library called Enzyme. Enzyme is a test helper that we can use to create a subtree of a elements, using a shallow render. Within the subtree of elements, we can traverse to specific elements and simulate events on those elements, such as clicks.

Module 11
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can use callback props to pass state between components.

Summary
When building an application, we have to decide on one component that will "own" shared state. This presents a problem when we need to update this state from descendent elements as the descendents don't have direct access to the appropriate setState method. The solution to this issue is callback props.

Callback props themselves are functions that a child can invoke at any time.

When an ancestor component owns state but it doesn't own the nodes that will trigger events, we use callback props.

Callback props allow descendant components (child, grandchild, etc...) to notify their ancestor about events on nodes that the descendants own. The ancestor can then modify the state they own based on the event.

Module 12
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can decompose a design into a react component hierarchy and implement it with state and props.

Module 13
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can make HTTP requests to REST APIs using Fetch in a React app.

Summary
There are a lot of concepts covered in this section.

Form components may be controlled, that is, their state is managed within React itself. This is different from the form components that you have encountered before.
Using fetch we can make GET or POST request to server APIs. GET is used to request data from the server and POST is used to send new data to the server.
HTTP headers may be set using the fetch options. We used an Authorization header to send an API key, which the server uses to identify the client invoking the endpoint.
Always assume that errors may happen and write error handling code especially when doing network calls. You do not have control over the success of a network call.
Promises are a powerful way to reason about the order in which asynchronous code is executed. Fetch uses Promises because the duration of a network call is unpredictable but we want to perform some tasks only after the call is complete.
The componentDidMount() lifecycle method is the best place to request data from the server.
And there are a few things that were not touched even though they would be necessary in a real application. These will be covered in subsequent lessons.

Form validation. Always assume that the user will enter invalid data on a form and write code to handle that scenario.
The API key is usually a secret, but we simply used it in plain sight in the code. It would be better if we could somehow hide that key from prying eyes.

Module 14
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can implement client-side routing.

Summary
To use React Router in a web application you should use the react-router-dom module. This will give you a library of components and tools you can use to make your single-page-application (SPA) support multiple "paths". Each path in an SPA is a snapshot of the application in a certain state.

You can wrap your entire web client application in a BrowserRouter component to enable React Router features and then setup Routes that display components at certain paths. Using Link components in place of <a> or <button> components, you can trigger navigation to different paths which display different routes.

It's possible to trigger navigation programmatically by using the history object that's provided by React Router. The history object contains a push method for triggering navigation or a goBack method for navigating to the previous page. Programmatic navigation is useful for navigating after events or in certain conditions; such as after a successful API response is received or the user is not logged in so they don't have permission to view that route.

Module 15
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can use context to read state in deeply nested components.

Summary
Context is a React feature that helps us with data that's shared between multiple components in a global like quality. To read context in a component we can use "static" on a class or a render prop as children to a Context.Consumer.

When using a render prop, you pass a function as a prop to a component, and the return value from the function will be JSX elements. When using Context.Consumer, the render prop we pass in will be given the value stored in context as an argument for us to use when deciding what JSX to return.

Module 16
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you'll be able to update context for managing state in deeply nested components

Summary
To update values in context, we need to use a Context.Provider component and pass in the updates as a prop named value. When rendering a provider, the new value will only be available in that provider's component subtree.

We can use the state of a class component as mutable values and pass in that state as the context provider's value prop. We can also pass updater functions (callback context values) from the class component into the context, this allows components in the subtree to update the state and update the context!

Solution: https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/noteful-client/tree/implement-context/src

Module 17
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can build complex forms in a React app.

Module 18
Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, you can securely automate the deployment of a create-react-app project.
