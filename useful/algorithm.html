	We'll do the same topic as last time (Trees and Graphs) with some different problems. Here are some study materials,
Definitions and terminology:
Harvard's CS50 lecture on data structures. You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s
Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs


Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.:
Playlist of videos explaining graph theory topics and algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P
Plus implementations in Java: https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/tree/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory

Special topics:
Chapter 7 on Dijikstraâ€™s algorithm from Grokking Algorithms: https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-7/1

Wikipedia articles on Minimum Spanning Trees: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree
And Spanning Forests:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree#Spanning_forests


Finally, I'd like to experiment with posting the problems ahead of time. I'm finding it helpful to revisit problems, perhaps you would like to review these ahead of time and revisit them during the event.
Here they are:
